#  Buzz vs. Aldrin   

**Buzz vs. Aldrin** is a thrilling **sci-fi adventure** where you step into the shoes of **Aldrin**, a boy who wakes up in the dead of night and listens to the voice of his **smart home AI**. Something has gone terribly wrong—**metal-eating futuristic bugs** have infiltrated the apartment vents, threatening to destroy his **billion-dollar hyper-futuristic home**.  

##  The Challenge  
But there’s a catch—these bugs are **drawn to light**, swarming around every illuminated area within the apartment. To save his home, Aldrin must **track and capture 100 bug swarms**, navigating through the apartment using a **new gravity shift technology** that alters movement in mind-bending ways.  

##  Are You Ready?  
Outsmart the swarm, **secure Aldrin’s future**, and protect his high-tech home before it’s too late!
